1. 
Instance Methods: Defined on the prototype of the class and can be called on instances of the class.
Static Methods: Defined on the class itself and cannot be called on instances, only on the class.

2. How Js Handles Concurrency
js handles concurrency using an event loop/ queue.  allowing asynchronous operations like  timers,promises, thread to run non-blocking code.

3. What is Async/Await? How Does It Differ from Using Promise Instance Methods?
Async/Await: working with promises, making asynchronous code look synchronous. async functions implicitly return a promise, and await pauses execution until the promise resolves.
Promise Instance Methods: Use then, catch, and finally for handling asynchronous operations, which can lead to more nested and less readable code compared to async/await.

4.Can You Use Await Outside of an Async Function?
No, await can only be used inside an async function. Using it outside will result in a syntax error.

5. What is Callback Hell and Why is it Considered a Problem?
Callback Hell: Refers to the situation where multiple nested callback functions make code difficult to read and maintain. It leads to deeply nested code structures, remain hard for code readability and debugging
